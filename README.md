Because GitHub asked to do

Okay,looks like this stuff is easier than I thought!

About:me::

I love Movies so much.Especially Suspence thriler movies.
I am into programming as well.
C was my first language and i like it so much.
Later saw Phython and Java but (still learning) but the feeling is not same as i got during C.
I still like C more probably because it was my starting language and i was very happy when i learned small things for myself and experimenting new things and the satisfaction that i get when my code has no error and is working or i have cracked something that i never thought i would.
This all is my expierience.
Looking for similar expierience in GitHub.
